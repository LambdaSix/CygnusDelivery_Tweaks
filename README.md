# CygnusDelivery_Tweaks
Mild tweaks to the Delivery (Stock-like Cygnus) mod by Beale 

- Adds B9 Part Switch & WBI OmniStorage variants of the main fuselage tank
- Makes the BT-4 Engine slightly more capable -- 20kN of vacuum thrust rather than 8.
- B9 Part Switch options for the service module to switch between LFO, LF, O, MonoProp, Xenon and structural
- Additional option for LH2O & LH2 if CyroTanks installed (including boilofF)
  This changes the effective fuel payloads a little due to the way B9 calculates tank size
